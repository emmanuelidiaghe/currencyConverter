# currencyConverter
A web-based app that converts between currencies

This is a simple web-based currency converter that converts between currencies of any two of the countries listed in the table. 
The converter was first designed for manual computations by matching properties of an object but was later upgraded to using third-party API which allows for real-time exchange rates.
* Users may add new countries, currency and currency notation and these will be updated on the table and radio buttons appropriately.
* The converter uses the currency ISO code entered by the user to obtain exchange rates, therefore, users should ensure that only correct data is entered in the input fields as they cannot be changed or deleted after submission; hence, the prompt to enter "Y" or "y" to confirm or "N" or "n" to abort submission.
